		<h1>Our Mission</h1>

	<p>
	The mission of Job Genius is to help young people identify careers and jobs they will both enjoy and find meaningful. 
	We aim to accomplish this goal by creating the worldâ€™s largest library of video informational interviews with professionals 
	answering typical career questions and showing shots of them on the job. We will grow this library through user generated content. 
	Any professional in the world can come to our site and upload an informational interview directly from their smart phone or tablet. 
	In this way, young people will be able to learn about any job directly from the professionals doing it. Who are we? We are a ragtag 
	group of college students from UCLA and OSU, doing our part to make the world a better and happier place. We will never 
	charge students to access your informational interview.
